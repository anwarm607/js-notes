## Build-In Objects
In JavaScript, built-in objects are objects that are provided by the language itself and are available globally without the need for explicit instantiation. These objects are an essential part of the JavaScript standard and offer various functionalities for performing common tasks. Built-in objects can be divided into several categories:

**Standard Built-in Objects**: These are objects defined by the ECMAScript specification and are available in all JavaScript environments, such as web browsers and Node.js.

Examples:

-   `Object`: The base object from which all other objects inherit.
-   `Array`: Used to store and manipulate arrays of data.
-   `String`: Used for manipulating and working with strings.
-   `Number`: Provides functionality related to numeric values.
-   `Boolean`: Represents the two boolean values: `true` and `false`.
-   `Date`: Used for working with dates and times.
-   `Math`: Provides mathematical functions and constants.
1.  **Global Objects**: These are objects that are available in the global scope, meaning you can access them anywhere in your code without explicitly creating instances.
    
    Examples:
    
    -   `console`: Used for logging messages to the browser console or the Node.js terminal.
    -   `setTimeout`, `setInterval`: Functions for scheduling the execution of code after a delay or at regular intervals.
    -   `JSON`: Used for working with JSON data.
2.  **Error Objects**: These are objects used to represent and handle errors that may occur during JavaScript execution.
    
    Examples:
    
    -   `Error`: The base error object from which other error types are derived.
    -   `SyntaxError`, `TypeError`, `ReferenceError`, etc.: Specific error types for different error scenarios.
3.  **Other Built-in Objects**: There are additional built-in objects provided by JavaScript for specific purposes.
    
    Examples:
    
    -   `RegExp`: Used for working with regular expressions.
    -   `Promise`: Provides a mechanism for handling asynchronous operations.
    -   `Map`, `Set`: Data structures for managing collections of data.
    -   `Symbol`: Used for creating unique property keys.

These built-in objects enhance the functionality of JavaScript and form the foundation of the language's capabilities. Developers use them extensively to build web applications, server-side applications, and more.

Examples,

1. **Object**: The base object from which all other objects inherit. It provides various utility methods for working with objects.

   ```javascript
   const person = { name: "John", age: 30 };
   const keys = Object.keys(person); // ['name', 'age']
   const values = Object.values(person); // ['John', 30]
   let isObjHasNameKey = person.hasOwnProperty('name') //true or false 
   ```

2. **Array**: Used to store and manipulate arrays of data.

   ```javascript
   const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0); // 15
   const doubled = numbers.map((num) => num * 2); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
   let arr = Array(10).fill('1');
   ```

3. **String**: Used for manipulating and working with strings.

   ```javascript
   const text = "Hello, world!";
   const length = text.length; // 13
   const uppercase = text.toUpperCase(); // "HELLO, WORLD!"
   const substr = text.substring(0, 5); // "Hello"
   ```

4. **Number**: Provides functionality related to numeric values.

   ```javascript
   const num = 42.75;
   const rounded = Math.round(num); // 43
   const fixedDecimals = num.toFixed(1); // "42.8"
   let convertNum = Number("123");
   ```

5. **Boolean**: Represents the two boolean values: `true` and `false`.

   ```javascript
   const isLogged = true;
   const isNotLogged = false;
   let name = "Anwar"'
   let isValuePresent = Boolean(name);
   ```

6. **Date**: Used for working with dates and times.

   ```javascript
   const currentDate = new Date();
   const year = currentDate.getFullYear(); // e.g., 2023
   const month = currentDate.getMonth(); // e.g., 6 (months are zero-indexed)
   ```

7. **Math**: Provides mathematical functions and constants.

   ```javascript
   const pi = Math.PI; // 3.141592653589793
   const sqrt2 = Math.sqrt(2); // 1.4142135623730951
   const randomNum = Math.random(); // a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive)
   ```

These are just a few examples of the standard built-in objects available in JavaScript. They provide powerful functionalities and play a crucial role in developing JavaScript applications.

**Most commonly used Methods or Properties,**
**1. Math:**
**Methods:**

1.  `Math.abs(x)`: Returns the absolute value of a number `x`.
    
2.  `Math.ceil(x)`: Rounds a number `x` to the nearest greater or equal integer.
    
3.  `Math.floor(x)`: Rounds a number `x` to the nearest smaller or equal integer.
    
4.  `Math.round(x)`: Rounds a number `x` to the nearest integer, rounding halfway cases to the nearest even number.
    
5.  `Math.max(...args)`: Returns the largest of zero or more numbers passed as arguments.
    
6.  `Math.min(...args)`: Returns the smallest of zero or more numbers passed as arguments.
    
7.  `Math.sqrt(x)`: Returns the square root of a non-negative number `x`.
    
8.  `Math.random()`: Returns a pseudo-random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).
