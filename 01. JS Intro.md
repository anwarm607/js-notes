# Intro for JS
**Javascript** is a programming language used mostly in Web technologies to develop interactive websites, web apps also backend server. In initial days Javascript used within browser only but now with the use of external JavaScript engines. Before framework like Node.js., this Javascript code can executed within the web browsers only with the use of the browser inbuilt engines, In Node.Js environment, they took engine out of the browser and gives most of the backend language capabilities like file system management, socket etc., to the Javascript.

Some examples of engines that used in browsers,
**V8** - Chrome, Opera, Edge...
**Spider Monkey** - Mozilla firefox.

# Ways of include JS to a website

**1. Scripts within HTML Page**
```markup
    <!DOCTYPE HTML>
    <html>
	    <body>
		    <p>Before the script...</p>
			 <script> alert( 'Hello, world!' );</script>
		 </body>
	</html>
```

**2. Scripts imported externally and Linked inside HTML**
```markup
    <!DOCTYPE HTML>
    <html>
	    <body>
		    <p>Before the script...</p>
			 <script src="/path/to/script.js"></script>
		 </body>
	</html>
```

Note: If  `src`  is set, the script content is ignored.

A single  `<script>`  tag can’t have both the  `src`  attribute and code inside.

This won’t work:
```markup
<script src="file.js">
	alert(1); // the content is ignored, because src is set 
</script>
```
We must choose either an external  `<script src="…">`  or a regular  `<script>`  with code.

The example above can be split into two scripts to work:
```markup
<script src="file.js"></script>
<script>
	alert(1);
</script>
```

## Building blocks of code

**1. Statements**
```js
alert('Hello');  
alert('World');
```
Statements are separated by semicolons and line by line for readability.

**2. Semicolons**
In most case we do not need to have semicolon at the end of the statement but it is best practice to have because in some cases it throws error.

**3. Comments**
As time goes on, programs become more and more complex. It becomes necessary to add  _comments_  which describe what the code does and why.

Comments can be put into any place of a script. They don’t affect its execution because the engine simply ignores them.

**One-line comments start with two forward slash characters  `//`.**
```js
// This comment occupies a line of its own  
alert('Hello');  
alert('World');  // This comment follows the statement
```
**Multiline comments start with a forward slash and an asterisk  `/*`  and end with an asterisk and a forward slash  `*/`.**
Like this:
```js
/* An example with two messages.
This is a multiline comment.
*/
alert('Hello');
alert('World');
```

The content of comments is ignored, so if we put code inside  `/* … */`, it won’t execute.

Sometimes it can be handy to temporarily disable a part of code:
```js
/* Commenting out the code
alert('Hello');
*/
alert('World');

```

## Variable

It is like a storage which has its own name. We can store different types of data in it. 
In Javascript we use following **keywords** to define variable,
1. var
2. let
3. const

**Behavior**
var - It can be reassignable
let - It can be reassignable
const - It can not be reassignable
```javascript
let message;  
message = 'Hello'; // store the string 'Hello' in the variable named message_
```
```javascript
let user = 'John';
```

```javascript
let user = 'John', age = 25, message = 'Hello';
```
We can reassign let or var variables,
```javascript
let user = 'John';
user='Jackey';
```
But we cannot reassign const variables,
```javascript
const user = 'John';
user='Jackey'; // This will throw error
```

**Variable naming**
In Javascript, it has its own rule to give a name for a variable. 
1.  The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols  `$`  and  `_`.
2.  The first character must not be a digit.
3. The variable name should not be a reserved keyword
```javascript
const user12&* = 'Anwar'; //This will not work
let 12user = 'Anwar'; //This will not work
let const = 'Anwar'; //This will not work
```

Bestpractices,
1. Variable name should be in camelCase.
2. Variable name should be in human readable form. like., userName, firstName, personHistory., 
	i. Bad names examples., let a = "aaa", let x = "asda"

## Data types
A value in JavaScript is always of a certain type. For example, a string or a number.
Types are divided into two parts,
1. Primitive Data type
2. Reference Data type

**1. Primitive Data type**

```javascript
// String
let user = "Anwar";
// Number
let age = 28;

// Boolean
let isMale = true;

// Null
let address = null; // Null

let dob; // undefined

let dob = undefined;

// To know a datatype,
typeof dob;
typeof user;
```

**2. Reference Data Type**

	1. Objects
	2. Arrays
	3. Functions
1. Object
Syntax:  
```javascript
	{
     "key": "value" //- key value pair
     }
```
Example:
```javascript
let emptyObj = {};
let userInfo = {
name: "Anwar",
age: 28,
gender: "Male"
}
```
Access object by dot notation,
```javascript
console.log(userInfo.name); // Anwar
console.log(userInfo.age); // 28
console.log(userInfo.gender); // Male
```
 Access object by bracket notation - Square bracket
```javascript
console.log(userInfo["name"]);  // Anwar
console.log(userInfo["age"]);  // 28
console.log(userInfo["gender"]); // Male
```
Change Object  value by dot notation,
```javascript
userInfo.name = "Mohamed"
```
Change Object  value by bracket notation,
```javascript
userInfo["name"] = "Mohamed"
```
Insert a key and value to an Object,

```javascript
userInfo.location = "Chennai"
person["Work Experience"]="4 Years"
```
*Note: While insert or change a key you can bypass the variable rules for key by inserting/changing key using bracket notation.*

Nested Object:

```javascript
let person = {
    name: "Md Anwar",
    age: 27,
    address: "333 North steet",
    isMarried: false,
    siblings: {
        firstSibling: {
            name: "Abdulla",
            age: 28
        },
        secondSibling: {
            name: "Person 2",
            age: 12
        },
    }
}

// Nested object access
console.log(personWithNestedObj.siblings.firstSibling.name)
console.log(personWithNestedObj["siblings"]["secondSibling"]["name"])
```
Check data type,
```javascript
typeof person;
``` 

**2. Array**

Syntax:
```javascript
["string", 28, false]
```
Example:
```javascript
let favFruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Mango"];
let emptyArr = [];
let favColours = ["Red", "Purple", "Violet", "white"] // Array of string
let favNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] //Array of numbers

let persons= [ {name: "Anwar", age: 27}, {name: "Kiran", age: "26"} ]; // Array of object
// Nested Array
let wholeNumber = [1,"3",5,7,[12,4,6,8], {name: "Anwar", age: 27}, true]
typeof favFruits;
```
Access array,
```javascript
 favFruits[0]; //Apple
 favFruits[2]; // Mango
 favFruits[1]; // Orange
```
Change or Insert array value,
```javascript
 favFruits[1] = "Papaya";
 favFruits[3] = "Mango";
 favFruits[6] = "Gauva";
```
Access array length,
```javascript
favFruits.length; // 7
```

**3. Function**
Syntax:
```javascript
function addTwoNumber() {
let firstNum = 54;
let secondNum = 42;
let addNum = firstNum + secondNum;
console.log(addNum);
};

addTwoNumber();
```
