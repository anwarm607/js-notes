9. Explain the differences between using "==" and "===" for equality comparisons in JavaScript.

10. Explain the difference between Object.keys(), Object.values(), and Object.entries() methods in JavaScript.

11. How can you determine the length of an object (the number of its own properties) without using any library or external dependencies?

12. What are the commonly used methods of the Array object? Provide examples of each method's usage.

13. How can you convert a string to lowercase using string built-in methods?

14. What is the purpose of the Math object in JavaScript? Provide examples of its usage for mathematical operations.

15. Explain the role of the Date object in JavaScript, and how can you get the current date and time using this object?

16. How do you check if a value exists in an array using built-in methods? How does this differ from checking if a value exists in an object?

17. Describe the purpose of the JSON object in JavaScript. How can you convert a JavaScript object to a JSON string and vice versa?

18. Explain the difference between String.prototype.slice() and String.prototype.substring() methods in JavaScript.

19. How can you add or remove elements from the beginning or end of an array using built-in methods?

20. How you can iterate an array and object?. Provide Example.


## Coding Challenges:

1. Write a function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum.

2. Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the largest number in the array.

3. Implement a function to check if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward). Ignore spaces and punctuation.

4. Create a program that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion.

5. Implement a function that takes an array of strings as input and returns a new array with only the strings that have a length greater than a specified number.

6. Write a function that converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

7. Implement a function that takes an object with properties representing courses and their corresponding grades. Calculate and return the GPA (Grade Point Average) of the student.

8. Create a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and lets the user guess the number. Provide feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

9. Write a function that takes a sentence as input and returns the most frequent word(s) in the sentence.

10. Implement a function that sorts an array of objects based on a specified property of the objects.

11. Write a function that checks if a given number is prime.

12. Implement a function that reverses a string without using the built-in reverse() method.

13. Create a program that finds the first n Fibonacci numbers.

14. Write a function that checks if two strings are anagrams (contain the same characters but in a different order).

15. Implement a function that sorts an array of numbers using the bubble sort algorithm.

16. Write a function that finds the intersection of two arrays (i.e., elements that are present in both arrays).

17. Create a program that generates a random password with a given length and includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

18. Implement a function that flattens a nested array (e.g., [1, [2, [3, 4]]] should become [1, 2, 3, 4]).

19. Write a function that takes a Roman numeral as input and converts it to an integer.

20. Implement a function that finds the longest word in a sentence and returns its length.
